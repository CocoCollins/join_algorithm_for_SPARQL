# join_algorithm_for_SPARQL
Implementation of Join Algorithm for SPARQL Query Processing

There are 4 parts In this repository:
- Convert SPARQL to relational database by *Vertically Patitioned Approach*
- Hash Join Algorithm
- Sort-merge Join Algorithm
- Improved algorithm: Introduce a partitioned phase before joining

Of course, the running time test codes are also included.
